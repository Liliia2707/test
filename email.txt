Hello, Rowan!

I am writing to you about the progress of our project.

I want to tell you how our project is going. Our team is working hard, and we finished some parts already. We are keeping up with the schedule and everything will be on time.I think next Friday the project will be ready as we discussed. If you have any questions or need more details, just let us know.

Keep in touch,
